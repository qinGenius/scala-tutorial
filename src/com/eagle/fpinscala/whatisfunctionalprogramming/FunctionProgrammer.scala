/**
  * As we'll learn, any function with side effects can be split into a pure function at the "core"
  * and possibly a pair of functions with side effects;
  * one on the input side, and one on the output side.
  * This is what we did when we separated the declaration of the winner
  * from our pure function winner.
  * This transformation can be repeated to push side effects to the "outer layers" of the program.
  * Functional programmers often speak of implementing programs with a pure core
  * and a thin layer on the outside that handles effects.
  * We will return to this principle again and again throughout the book.
